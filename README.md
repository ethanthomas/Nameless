# Nameless - What is it?

Have you ever wanted to meet new people? Did you ever wonder how unique those who surround you are? Have you ever been just too nervous to walk up and make the first move? First encounters are tough but we have a solution. We’re proud to introduce Nameless.

Through our simple to use interface, users can get connected to seemingly random others in their surrounding area. Our Parse powered backend will ensure data security and anonymity. The disclosure of any information regarding yourself is entirely up to you. You are just another local end-user until you decide you don’t want to be. But don’t just stick to text! You can also send pictures to your new friends to keep the conversation interesting. And with Android Wear integration we’ve insured that you’ll never miss a notification!
